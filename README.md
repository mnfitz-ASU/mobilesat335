# mobilesat335
Final Project for CSE 335
- Idea: Make a mobile IOS app utilizing 2 APIs and a database to demonstrate proficiency in mobile development.

This project was assigned as a final project for CSE 335. It was required that the app be programed for IOS using XCode and that the app relied on two external APIs and a database. Having a unique premise was also heavily encouraged, as well as developing the app with a team. For this final project I chose not work with a team, and decided to make the app track satellites. For the required APIs, the app gets satellite orbital data from Celestrak.com and gets map data from Apple maps. Since the instructor deemed that coredata qualifies as a database, it was used to store data persistently. My goal for this project was to create an app which tracks selected satellites in real time on a map. I figured that would be a novel concept which potential consumers would take interest in, as well as an effectual and relatively complex application which would demonstrate my understanding of mobile development to the instructor
<br/>
**Note**: This code is entirely in Swift using XCode, as it is a required by the instructor.
